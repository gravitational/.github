Welcome to the @graviational Github Org, home of [Teleport](https://goteleport.com/). Teleport is the easiest, most secure way to access infrastructure. The open-source Teleport Access Plane consolidates connectivity, authentication, authorization, and audit into a single platform. By consolidating all aspects of access for engineers and the software they write, Teleport reduces attack surface area, cuts operational overhead, easily enforces compliance, and improves productivity.

## History of @graviational Github Org
Teleport started it's life as Gravitational. What we built at Gravitational is Gravity and Teleport. The Gravity project was meant to be the “runtime” for this computer, while the goal of Teleport was to provide an easy way to access it. In November of 2020, [Gravitational re-branded as Teleport](https://goteleport.com/blog/gravitational-is-teleport/) and since then we've continued to execute Teleports mission to enable engineers to quickly access any resource anywhere.
